            Homeschooling your child can seem daunting - but don't worry, you
            can do it! There are tons of programs and readable material
            available that will not only get you started, but carry you all of
            the way through this wonderful journey.

            It's important to remember that this is a unique opportunity to
            connect with your child - most children do not get the constant
            one-on-one attention that homeschooling provides! But also remember
            that boundaries need to be set in place.

            Don't forget to play & craft! Most kids love crafting - and what kid
            doesn't want to play? This is also another wonderful way to not only
            get some fun time in, but also use it in a constructive and
            educational way.

            Don't be afraid to encourage alone play time for your child.
            Homeschooling has a lot of advantages, but it also has it's
            disadvantages - one of them being, when do you two get time away
            from each other? I mean, you can't exactly run away from your child
            can you?? You can use some of the time during the day, maybe even
            just 30 minutes to 1 hour, of "alone" play time for your child. You
            can help them understand that it's okay to play by themselves by
            engaging in something yourself as well, like reading a book.
